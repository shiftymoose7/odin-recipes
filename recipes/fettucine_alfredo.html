    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo was originally made with only cheese and butter, but these days, especially in the U.S., it's made with heavy cream or half and half to enrich the sauce. This recipe is an homage to how it was originally made.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz. fettuccine or other long pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Half a stick of unsalted butter cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of freshly grated parmesean cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook <strong>12 oz. fettuccine or other long pasta</strong> in a large pot of boiling salted water over high heat, stirring occasionally, until very al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Transfer 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to a large skillet. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, then gradually whisk in <strong>¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter</strong>, cut into small pieces, no more than 1 Tbsp. at a time, until melted. Whisking constantly, gradually add <strong>¾ cup (75 g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</strong>, making sure it is completely melted and incorporated before adding more. Add cooked pasta and toss to coat, adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce blankets noodles completely.
